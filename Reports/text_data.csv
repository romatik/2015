ADVANCES-Advanced Development in Social Work,Ana Godonoga,Xinyu Wang,,"Section 3.1 measures students’ satisfaction with the support received before the start of their Erasmus Mundus course. When analyzing the findings, it is important to mention that throughout the entire report, higher levels of satisfaction are measured in terms of percentages of “very satisfied” responses, while lower levels are treated as the sum of “very unsatisfied” and “unsatisfied” responses. 

Graph 3.1.1 provides information on students’ satisfaction with the support received by the program consortia as a whole. The following 6 indicators were used in this question:  (1) “Course content”, (2) “Enrolling in classes”, (3) “Evaluation methods”, (4) “Information about field work”, (5) “Standards of behavior”, and (6) “Timetable”. Overall, the graph shows that the majority of respondents reported being “somewhat satisfied” or “very satisfied” with the information and support received by the consortia in terms of all 6 indicators. Lower levels of satisfaction (as measured by the sum of “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” responses) were recorded for the following indicators: “Information about fieldwork” (21%), “Evaluation methods” (17%), “Timetable” (12%), “Course content” (8%), and “Enrolling in classes” (4%). Nevertheless, all of these indicators fall in the fourth quartile, except for “Course content” and “Information about fieldwork”, which appear to be in the third quartile (see Table 1). Higher levels of satisfaction (as measured by the percentages of “very satisfied” responses) were recorded for the indicators “Enrolling in classes” (71%), and “Standards of behavior” (65%). Both indicators fall in the fourth quartile.

Apart from rating their satisfaction with the consortia, students were also asked to rate the support received from each university (graphs 3.1.2 & 3.1.3). The following 7 indicators were used in this question: (1) “Accommodation”, (2) “Banking”, (3) “Estimation of living expenses”, (4) “Health insurance”, (5) “Language courses”, (6) “Local transportation”, and (7) “Visa issues”. The majority of students reported being either “very satisfied” or “somewhat satisfied” with the support provided by Aalborg University (n=25) and the University of Lincoln (n=24). In the case of Aalborg University, it is important to note that all indicators registered a certain number of “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” responses. Indicators with the lowest levels of satisfaction have been identified as follows: “Banking” (41%), “Estimation of living expenses” (24%), and “Local transportation” (20%). In addition, more than 50% of respondents stated being “very satisfied” with three indicators – “Accommodation” (55%), “Health insurance” (55%) and “Local transportation” (52%). In the case of the University of Lincoln, the lowest levels of satisfaction were recorded for the indicators “Accommodation” (29%), “Estimation of living expenses” (21%), and “Local transportation” (14%). Students reported being “very satisfied” with the support offered in regards to “Banking” (75%), “Visa issues” (75%), “Health insurance” (74%), and “Language courses” (74%). Due to a low number of respondents, findings concerning the Technical University of Lisbon were not included in this analysis. 
","Section 3.2 measures students’ satisfaction with the support received by the consortia and by individual universities during the orientation program. The following 8 indicators were used in this analysis: (1) “Academic staff”, (2) “Administrative staff”, (3) “Buddy or tutor system”, (4) “International Student Office”, (5) “Library”, (6) “Other students”, (7) “Student associations”, and (8) “University facilities”. 

Graph 3.2.1 provides information on students’ satisfaction with the support received by the program consortia during the orientation program. Overall, the majority of respondents stated being “very satisfied” or “somewhat satisfied” with all indicators. The lowest levels of satisfaction were recorded for the indicators “Student associations” (18%), “Other students” (12%), and “International Student Office” (12%). In addition, the indicators “International Student Office” and “Other students” fall in the second quartile, and “Student associations” – in the third quartile (see Table 2). Students were “very satisfied” with the support received from “Academic staff” (83%), “Library” (79%), “University facilities” (71%), and “Administrative staff” (71%). All these indicators appear to be in the fourth quartile. 

Twenty-five respondents rated their satisfaction with the support provided by Aalborg University during the orientation period. The lowest levels of satisfaction were recorded for the indicators “Student associations” (25%) and “Buddy or tutor system” (15%). The highest levels of satisfaction were registered for the indicators: “Library” (71%), “University facilities” (71%) and “Academic staff” (70%). Eighteen respondents rated their satisfaction with the support offered by the Technical University of Lisbon during the orientation period. Due to a limited number of responses, only four indicators were included in this analysis: (1) “Academic staff”, (2) “Administrative staff”, (3) “Library”, and (4) “University facilities”. The levels of satisfaction with the “Academic staff” and “Administrative staff” are somewhat mixed. Results concerning the indicators “Library” and “University facilities” show a more alarming situation. Approximately 70% of respondents reported being “somewhat unsatisfied” or “very unsatisfied’ with the introduction process to “Library”, and 50% - with the “University facilities”. Twenty-four respondents rated their satisfaction with the support offered by the University of Lincoln. The level of satisfaction with the institutional support offered during the orientation period appears to be the highest, compared to the other two universities. Two indicators recorded slightly lower levels of satisfaction: “Buddy or tutor system” (15%), and “Student associations” (13%). Highest levels of satisfaction were identified for the indicators “Administrative staff” (88%), “Library” (88%), “Academic staff” (79%), and “University facilities” (79%). 
","Section 3.3 measures students’ satisfaction with the helpfulness of different units and people. Students were asked to rate their satisfaction with the consortia and with individual universities respectively. Eight indicators were used in this section – (1) “Academic staff”, (2) “Administrative staff”, (3) “Buddy or tutor system”, (4) “International Student Office”, (5) “Library”, (6) “Other students”, (7) “Student associations”, and (8) “University Facilities”. Overall, the summary statistics table shows that students are generally satisfied with the helpfulness of the aforementioned units of people. Lowest levels of satisfaction were recorded for the indicators “Student associations” (26%), “Other students” (12%), and “International Student Office” (9%). These indicators are distributed in the second, first, and third quartile respectively (see Table 3). Highest levels of satisfaction were recorded for the indicators “Academic staff” (83%), “Administrative staff” (67%), and “Library” (62%). These measures fall in the fourth quartile. In the case of Aalborg University, respondents (n=25) expressed a somewhat lower level of satisfaction with respect to “Student associations” (27%) and “Other students” (15%). As regards the remaining indicators, 50% of respondents or more indicated being “very satisfied” with the helpfulness of the given units of people. 

In the case of the Technical University of Lisbon, only 4 indicators were analyzed due to a limited number of responses. These indicators are (1) “Academic staff”, (2) “Administrative staff”, (3) “Library”, and (4) “University facilities”. As it appeared in the previous question, more than half of respondents (total n=18) reported being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with the “Library” (60% of “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” responses) and “University facilities” (60% of “somewhat unsatisfied” responses). As regards “Academic staff” and “Administrative staff”, the majority of students reported being either “somewhat satisfied’ or “very satisfied”. The University of Lincoln recorded the highest level of student satisfaction among the three institutions. Somewhat lower levels of satisfaction were identified in the case of “Student associations” (14%) and “Buddy or tutor system” (12%). On the other hand, students reported being “very satisfied” with the helpfulness of the “Library” (91%), “Academic staff” (83%) and “University facilities” (83%).
","Section 3.4 measures students’ satisfaction with the support received on various issues. With respect to the support provided by the program consortia as a whole, students were asked to rate their satisfaction in regards to 2 indicators: (1) “Financial issues” and (2) “Health insurance”. The graph shows that although the majority of students reported being “very satisfied” or “somewhat satisfied” with the support received, these indicators fall in the second and third quartile, as shown in table 4. 

As far as individual universities are concerned, students were asked to rate their satisfaction with (1) the “Availability of extracurricular activities” and (2) the “Quality of extracurricular activities”. It is important to mention that due to a limited number of responses, only Alborg University and the University of Lincoln were included in this analysis. In the case of Aalborg University, approximately one third of respondents (total n=25) reported being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with the “Availability of extracurricular activities”, and almost 40% stated being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with the “Quality of extracurricular activities”. In the case of the University of Lincoln, students' satisfaction with both indicators was higher. Approximately 90% of respondents (total n=24) stated being “very satisfied” or “somewhat satisfied” with the “Quality of extracurricular activities”. At the same time, 19% of respondents stated being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with the “Availability of extracurricular activities”. This finding perhaps suggests that while the quality of activities might be high, they are not necessarily made available to students.
","Section 4.1 measures students’ satisfaction with the evaluation and module assessment. Respondents were asked to rate their satisfaction with respect to 10 indicators (see graph 4.1.1). As regards the consortia, lower levels of satisfaction were recorded for the following indicators: “Clarity of evaluation criteria across universities” (38%), “Feedback on evaluation results and grades” (25%), “Formalized system by university consortium for students to share opinions and feedback on course” (19%), and “Grade conversion across universities” (17%). On the contrary, a considerable number of students reported being “very satisfied” with the “Availability of course coordinator to discuss questions or problems related to [their] studies and mobility experience” (87%) and “The willingness and availability of the course coordinator to follow up on unresolved issues addressed” (88%). All of the indicators used in this question fall either in the third or fourth quartile (see Table 5). 

In the case of Aalborg University, 6 indicators were used to measure students’ satisfaction with the evaluation and assessment provided by the institution (see graph 4.1.2). Overall, the majority of respondents (total n=25) reported being “very satisfied” or “somewhat satisfied” with all indicators. One indicator that scored a lower level of satisfaction is “Feedback on evaluation results and grades”, where approximately 33% of respondents stated being “somewhat unsatisfied”.  In the case of the Technical University of Lisbon, 5 indicators were presented (see graph 4.1.3). Approximately one third of respondents (total n=18) reported being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with the “Formalized system through which students can share their opinions and provide feedback on the EM course”, “Feedback on evaluation results and grades” and “The quality of the feedback channels at this university”. In addition, 27% stated being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with the “Ability to provide feedback on the quality of courses” and 18% expressed being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with the “Ability to provide feedback on the quality of services offered”. As regards the University of Lincoln, students’ satisfaction with the module assessment was the highest among all institutions. The university could improve further on the “Feedback on evaluation results and grades”, given that 12% of respondents stated being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with this dimension. The indicator with the highest level of satisfaction is “Implementation of recommendations given by students to improve EM course experience” (74%).
","In section 5.1, students were asked to rate their satisfaction with the organization of teaching and learning at each university. Six indicators were used in this section: (1) “Academic support and advice from lectures”, (2) “Overall quality of teaching at this university”, (3) Skills development, (4) “Use of innovative technology in lectures”, (5) “Use of student centered learning strategies in lectures”, and (6) “Workload of the modules courses”. In the case of Aalborg University, more than half of respondents (total n=25) reported being “very satisfied” on all indicators, except for “Use of innovative technology in lectures”, where only 43% stated being “very satisfied” and 52% - “somewhat satisfied”. The incidence of “somewhat unsatisfied” responses was the lowest among all institutions, which indicates that on average, students are most satisfied with the teaching and learning provided by this university. In the case of the Technical University of Lisbon, students’ overall satisfaction with teaching and learning is lower compared to the results pertaining to Aalborg University. Around 36% of respondents (total n=18) stated being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with the indicators “Skills development” and “Use of student centered learning strategies in lectures”. In addition, 27% reported being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with the “Overall quality of teaching at this university”, “Use of innovative technology in lectures”, and “Workload of the modules courses”. As regards the University of Lincoln, more than half of respondents (total n=24) indicated being “very satisfied” on 4 out of 6 indicators. A higher level of dissatisfaction (as measured by the percentages of “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” responses) was recorded for the indicator “Workload of the modules courses” (42%) and “Skills development” (12%).
",Section 5.2 measures students’ satisfaction with the support provided by their first supervisor. All respondents seem to “agree” or “somewhat agree” with the statements: “My supervisor provided valuable advice during my thesis work” and “My supervisor was available for periodic meetings”. These indicators fall in the third and fourth quartile respectively (see Table 6).,"Section 5.3 measures students’ satisfaction with the support provided by their second supervisor.
Results reveal that students’ satisfaction with the guidance and support received from the second supervisor is somewhat lower compared to the satisfaction reported for the first supervisor. Approximately one third of respondents “disagree” or “somewhat disagree” with the statement: “My second supervisor was available for periodic meetings”. In addition, 27% “disagree” or “somewhat disagree” with the affirmation: “My supervisor provided valuable advice during my thesis work”. Furthermore, when asked to provide feedback on the statement “My second supervisor was available for consultation if the lead supervisor was unavailable”, 27% of respondents indicated that they “disagree” or “somewhat disagree”. All three indicators fall in the second quartile (see Table 7).
","As part of question 6.1, students were asked to reflect on their personal development during their Erasmus Mundus course. More specifically, students were presented with five statements related to career options, opportunities for employment, future education options, improvement of soft skills, academic and personal achievement, and were asked whether they agreed or disagreed with them. Results reveal that 82% of students “agree” that their soft skills were improved by their course, 70% “agree” that the course has enabled academic and personal achievement beyond their initial expectations, and 58% “agree” that their Erasmus Mundus course prepared them for their future career. On the other hand, 33% “disagree” or “somewhat disagree” that they feel optimistic about their opportunities for employment. In addition, 50% of respondents “disagree” or “somewhat disagree” that they were well advised on future education options. Table 8 reveals that all indicators covered in this section fall in the second and third quartiles.",,,,,Yes,yes,No,

CoDe-Joint European Master in Comparative Local Development,Kseniia Goroshko,Elizabeth Humberstone,,"Before the start of the course most students received enough support on standards of behaviour and enrolment process, however with 5% students being very dissatisfied with instructions on these two points.  Fifth of the students felt unsatisfied with course content and timetable. Overall 30 to 40% students report they need more careful guidance on evaluation methods and fieldwork. CoDe programme is evaluated to be in the first and second quartile respectively regarding the two points among the other Erasmus Mundus courses.

All three Universities, Corvinus University of Budapest,  University of Regensburg and University of Trento performed exceptionally well on local transportation support.
Estimation of living expenses worked well for the first two universities, but requires update from  University of Trento with more than fifth of the students giving negative feedback.
Accommodation support is an issue at Corvinus University of Budapest and  University of Trento with 20% student unsatisfied, compared to only 5% at  University of Trento.
Health insurance and visa issues show minor dissarisfaction at University of Regensburg. Most of the settle-up questions require more help at  University of Trento with approx. 15% student unsatisfied with banking, health insurance and language courses information. ","During the orientation program organised by universities very satisfactory performance was achieved on “Library” and all three university facilities information, where CoDe programme performed in the fourth quartile amount the other Erasmus Mundus courses. Less than a fifth of the students are somewhat unsatisfied with “Academic staff”, “Buddy or tutor system” and “International Student Office information”. The introductory process from “Administrative staff” and “Student associations” shows the least satisfaction, with 30 and 20% unsatisfied respectively. CoDe “Academic and Administrative staff” involvement in orientation process shows performance in the first quartile among all the EM courses.

","A quarter of students was dissatisfied with the help from “Administrative staff”. The “Buddy and tutor” system, “International office” and “Students associations” help was dissatisfactory for approx. 20% of students. Comparing with results from the previous section, this might be due to the fact that those students did not receive enough introductory information. Most of the students reported the opinion that university facilities were helpful, bringing CoDe to the fourth quartile amount other EM courses. “Student association” helpfulness also falls into the fourth quartile, despite the rather unsatisfactory student feedback. All three universities have high dissatisfaction rate with administrative staff helpfulness, ranging from 16 to 27%. 

University of Regensburg similar to report of the previous section has approx. 10% students unsatisfied with helpfulness of “Buddy and tutor system”, “Health services”, “International student office”, “Library” and “University facilities”. 10% of University of Trento found the “Health services” not helpful. “Buddy and tutor system”, “Library” and “Academic staff” showed minor dissatisfaction among 16-20% of the students.","The overall rating of support on various issues showed that 20 and 25% of the students are unsatisfied with ""Financial"" and ""Heath insurance"" issues respectively, with the first issue falling in the first quartile amoung results for other EM programs. 10% of the students have minor dissatisfaction with ""Inappropriate conduct or sexual harassment"" issues. 

Both University of Trento and University of Regensburg have most students satisfied with ""Availability and Quality of extracurricular activities"", with one student being very unsatisfied in the first university and two unsatisfied with ""Availability in the second one.

EM-SANF-European MSc in Sustainable Animal Nutrition and Feeding,Jacob Sydenham,Pouneh Eftekhari,"This report consolidates the feedback provided by students on various dimensions of the European MSc in Sustainable Animal Nutrition and Feeding (EM-SANF), and provides some commentary on the relevant indicators. The majority of students said they were ‘somewhat satisfied', with both the academic and overall delivery of the programme. More than a third of students said they were ‘very satisfied', according to the aforementioned indicators. It should be noted that, due to the unavailability of information on partner universities, student feedback pertains to the consortium as a whole. ","On the reverse, most students of the consortia (33%) were “Somewhat unsatisfied’’ with support regarding “Timetable’’ which fell in the second quartile with the mean score of 2.83.  Students were equally “Somewhat unsatisfied’’ with support regarding “Information about field work’’ which also consequently fell in the second quartile with the mean score of 2.93.  Survey respondents were “Very unsatisfied’’ with “Enrolling in classes” and “Evaluation methods’’ registering 6% and 3% respectively.","Again, students were very impressed with the support they received during the orientation programme; all but one of the six indicators falls in the fourth quartile. Staff and facilities were rated especially highly, with 91% of students claiming they were very satisfied with library services, and 75% claiming they were very satisfied with academic staff. Only the buddy/tutor systems, together with student associations, received negative feedback (totals of 20% and 18% respectively).","Using the same indicators as before, in terms of the quality of the help students received throughout the programme, more than two thirds of students said they were very satisfied with the 'academic staff' (71%) and the 'administrative staff' (71%).

The need for clarification of the ""Evaluation methods"" was expressed by 86 % of the students, with only 14 % of the students “very satisfied” with the provided support. Thus this indicator falls into the second quartile. Majority of the respondents, 66 %, would like to receive more ""Information about the fieldwork"". Moderate dissatisfaction of some students with ""Course content"" (14%) and ""Timetable"" (10%) suggests possible revision of these course elements. The students were most satisfied with the support received on ""Enrolling in classes"", making this indicator fall into the fourth quartile.

EMLE-European Master in Law and Economics,Ana Godonoga,Xinyu Wang,,"Section 3.1 measures students’ satisfaction with the support received before the start of their Erasmus Mundus course. When analyzing the findings, it is important to mention that throughout the entire report, higher levels of satisfaction are measured in terms of percentages of “very satisfied” responses, while lower levels are treated as the sum of “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” responses. 

Graph 3.1.1 provides information on students’ satisfaction with the support received by the program consortia as a whole. The following 6 indicators were used in this question:  (1) “Course content”, (2) “Enrolling in classes”, (3) “Evaluation methods”, (4) “Information about field work”, (5) “Standards of behavior”, and (6) “Timetable”. Overall, the graph shows that the majority of respondents reported being “somewhat satisfied” or “very satisfied” with the information and support received by the consortia in terms of all 6 indicators. A somewhat lower level of satisfaction (as measured by the sum of “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” responses) was recorded for the indicator “Information about fieldwork” (26%), which falls in the second quartile of the distribution table (Table 1). Higher levels of satisfaction (as measured by the percentages of “very satisfied” responses) were identified as regards “Enrolling in classes” (62%), and “Standards of behavior” (60%). Both indicators are located in the third quartile, while the remaining variables appear to be in the fourth quartile.

Apart from rating their satisfaction with the consortia, students were also asked to rate the support received from each university (graphs 3.1.2, 3.1.3 & 3.1.4). The following 7 indicators were used in this question: (1) “Accommodation”, (2) “Banking”, (3) “Estimation of living expenses”, (4) “Health insurance”, (5) “Language courses”, (6) “Local transportation”, and (7) “Visa issues”. The following four institutions were evaluated: Erasmus University Rotterdam, Ghent University, University of Bologna and University of Hamburg.

The majority of students reported being either “very satisfied” or “somewhat satisfied” with the support provided by the Erasmus University Rotterdam (n=59). All but one variable – “Accommodation”, recorded less than 50% of “very satisfied” responses. As a matter of fact, of all indicators the respective one registered the lowest level of satisfaction (20% of “very unsatisfied” and 24% of “somewhat unsatisfied” responses). On the other hand, students seemed to be most satisfied (68% of “very satisfied” responses) with the information and support received with respect to “Language courses”.In the case of Ghent University (n=25), it appears that while the overall satisfaction regarding the logistic information and support received before the beginning of studies is relatively high (a majority of “very satisfied” or “somewhat satisfied” responses), only 2 of the total number of indicators were marked as “very satisfied” by more than 50% of respondents, namely Local transportation” (55%) and “Visa issues” (60%). Indicators with the lowest levels of satisfaction were identified for: “Language courses” (37%), “Accommodation” (25%), “Banking” (18%), and “Health insurance” (18%). The University of Bologna (n=49) reported comparatively lower levels of student satisfaction with respect to the logistic information and support received before the beginning of studies. In fact, no indicators recorded more than 50% of “very satisfied” responses. The lowest levels of satisfaction were identified as regards “Accommodation” (28%), “Language courses” (28%), and “Banking” (24%). In the Case of the University of Hamburg (n=68), students were most satisfied (as measured by percentages of “very satisfied” responses) with the support received on issues, such as “Local transportation” (76%), “Health Insurance” (58%), “Language courses” (53%) and “Visa issues” (51%). It is worth noting that while the indicator “Language courses” was identified to be among the highest rated in terms of “very satisfied” responses, it is also the indicator for which 26% of respondents marked “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” as an answer. In addition, one quarter of respondents (25%) expressed being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with the support regarding “Accommodation” and 21% of respondents expressed feeling “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with the information received on “Health insurance”. 
","Section 3.2 measures students’ satisfaction with the support received by the consortia and by individual universities during the orientation program. The following 8 indicators were used in this analysis: (1) “Academic staff”, (2) “Administrative staff”, (3) “Buddy or tutor system”, (4) “International Student Office”, (5) “Library”, (6) “Other students”, (7) “Student associations”, and (8) “University facilities”. 

Graph 3.2.1 provides information on students’ satisfaction with the support received by the program consortia during the orientation program. Overall, more than 50% of respondents stated being “very satisfied” or “somewhat satisfied” with the introduction process to “Academic staff” (65%), “Administrative staff” (58%), “Other students” (57%), “Library”(52%) and “University facilities” (51%).  The lowest levels of satisfaction (as measured by the sum of “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” responses) were reported for the indicators “Buddy or tutor system” (43%) and “Student associations” (44%), which are also identified in the first quartile of the distribution table (Table 2). The remaining variables are located in the third quartile, except for “International Student Office”, which falls in the second quartile. 

When asked to rate their satisfaction with the introduction to the aforementioned units provided by the Erasmus University Rotterdam, 5 of the 8 indicators received more than 50% of “very satisfied” responses (“Academic staff” – 69%, “University facilities” – 68%, “Administrative staff” – 65%, “Library” – 63%,  and “Other students” – 57%). Lower levels of satisfaction were identified with respect to “Student associations” (31%), “International Student Office” (30%) and “Buddy or tutor system” (29%). With respect to Ghent University, the indicators with the highest levels of satisfaction (as measured by percentages of “very satisfied” responses) were: “Academic staff” (80%), “Administrative staff” (80%), “Other students” (60%), and “University facilities” (50%). On the contrary, students indicated being less satisfied with the introduction process to “Student associations” (39%), and “International Student Office” (24%). When asked to rate the introduction process to different units of people provided by the University of Bologna, students’ overall satisfaction was somewhat lower compared to the other institutions. The lowest levels of satisfaction were reported for the following indicators: “International Student Office” (32%), “Buddy or tutor system” (31%), and “Student associations” (31%). The highest level of satisfaction was identified for the variable “Other students” (67% of “very satisfied” responses). With respect to the University of Hamburg, approximately two thirds of respondents indicated being “very satisfied” with 5 indicators: “Library” (64%), “Academic staff” (63%), “Other students” (63%), “University facilities” (61%) and “Administrative staff” (60%). Likewise, variables rated with the highest frequency of “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” responses were: “Student associations” (37%), “International Student Office” (31%), and “Buddy or tutor system” (27%).  These findings reveal that the consortia as a whole and individual universities, as part of the orientation program, should pay increased attention to the introduction process to student associations, buddy or tutor systems and international student offices.

","Section 3.3 measures students’ satisfaction with the helpfulness of different units of people. Students were asked to rate their satisfaction with the consortia and with individual universities respectively. Eight indicators were used in this section – (1) “Academic staff”, (2) “Administrative staff”, (3) “Buddy or tutor system”, (4) “International Student Office”, (5) “Library”, (6) “Other students”, (7) “Student associations”, and (8) “University Facilities”. 

Overall, the summary statistics table shows that more than 50% of respondents marked being “very satisfied” with 5 indicators, that is “Academic staff” (69%), “Other students” (68%), “Administrative staff” (57%), Library (53%), and “University facilities” (51%). The first two indicators appear in the fourth quartile of the distribution table and the remaining three appear in the third quartile (Table 3). Lower levels of satisfaction (as measured by the percentage of “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” responses) were identified with respect to “Buddy or tutor system” (37%), “Student associations” (35%), and “International Student Office” (26%). These indicators fall in the first quartile of the distribution table. 

Generally, the majority of respondents expressed being “very satisfied” or “somewhat satisfied with the helpfulness of the aforementioned units at the Erasmus University Rotterdam. Six indicators received more than 50% of “very satisfied” responses, namely “University facilities” (69%), “Administrative staff” (67%), “Other students” (66%), “Academic staff” (65%), and “Library” (65%). Somewhat lower levels of satisfaction were identified with respect to “Buddy or tutor system” (29%), “Student associations” (29%), “Health services” (28%), and “International Student Office” (24%). As far as Ghent University is concerned, more than 50% of respondents stated being “very satisfied” with half of the indicators (4 out of 8) – “Academic staff” (68%), “Administrative staff” (68%), “Other students” (60%), and “University facilities” (50%). The lowest level of satisfaction among all indicators was identified for “Student associations” (36%). For the remaining ones, between 8% and 18% of respondents expressed being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied”. With respect to the University of Bologna, only two indicators of the total number were marked with “very satisfied” responses by more than 50% of respondents, namely “Other students” (67%), and “Academic staff” (56%). The reported levels of dissatisfaction were lower compared to the other institutions. Most notably, 35% of respondents reported being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with the helpfulness of the “Buddy or tutor system” and 30% - with the “International Student Office”. For the remaining indicators, between 4% and 26% of respondents expressed being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied”.

Reoccurring challenges were once again identified with respect to “International Student Office” (34% of “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied responses), “Student associations” (29%), “Health services” (27%), and “Buddy or tutor system” (25%). For the remaining indicators, between 7% and 10% of respondents expressed being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied”. 
","Section 3.4 measures students’ satisfaction with the support received on various issues. With respect to the support provided by the program consortia as a whole, students were asked to rate their satisfaction in regards to 3 indicators: (1) “Financial issues”, (2) “Health insurance” and (3) “Inappropriate conduct or sexual harassment issues”. The graph shows that only for the latter indicator, more than 50% of respondents expressed being “very satisfied” with the support received. With respect to “Financial issues”, 48% of respondents indicated being “very satisfied”, 30% - “somewhat satisfied”, and 22% reported being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied”.

For the remaining institutions, the percentage sum of “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” responses ranged from 19% to 32% for the first indicator, and from 19% to 26% for the second indicator.

","Section 4.1 measures students’ satisfaction with the evaluation and module assessment. Respondents were asked to rate their satisfaction with respect to 10 indicators (see graph 4.1.1). As regards the consortia, the highest proportion of respondents selected “somewhat satisfied” as an answer (34%-48% range). Only three of the total number of indicators were rated as “very satisfied” by 50% or more participants – “Information provided about the type of degree to be awarded” (53%), “Availability of course coordinator to discuss questions or problems related to my studies and mobility experience” (51%), and “Information provided about provision of certificates and transcripts” (50%). The latter indicator is situated in the fourth quartile of the distribution table and the former two – in the third quartile. On the other hand, between 12% and 31% of respondents expressed feeling “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” when asked to rate the respective indicators.

In all students in the consortia were generally satisfied as majority indicated either being “somewhat satisfied” (31% to 59%) or “very satisfied”  (36% to 50%). Nonetheless, majority of the means fall in the second quartile with the exception of “University facilities” in the first quartile whilst both “Academic staff’ and “Student associations” both fall in the fourth quartile. Many students in the consortia were “somewhat unsatisfied “with “Buddy or tutor system” (20%) whilst 5% were “very unsatisfied” with  both “Administrative staff” and “Academic staff”.

At the Carlos III University, most respondents were “very satisfied” (42% to 80%) and “somewhat satisfied” (20% to 58%) across all indicators with both “Academic staff” and “Administrative staff” registering the highest level of 80% “very satisfied”.

","Section 3.4 presents the students' satisfaction with the support received from the consortia and individual universities on three main issues:  (1) ""Financial issues"" ,(2) ""Health insurance"" and (3) Inappropriate conduct or Sexual harassment issues.
There is a general satisfaction with the level of support received from the consortia as 45% to 74% of respondents were “very satisfied “with such assistance received. The means were however evenly spread across the quartiles with “Health insurance” “Inappropriate conduct or sexual” and “Financial issues” in the first, second and third quartiles respectively. Most students in the consortia (74%) were “very satisfied” with assistance concerning  “Financial issues”.

At the Ghent University, 57% of respondents were “very satisfied” with “Availability of extracurricular Activities”.  At Henri Poincare University Nancy 1 28% of respondents are “very satisfied” with “Availability of extracurricular Activities” though 13% are “very unsatisfied” with  Quality of extracurricular activities”. Moreover at University of Stuttgart there is general high level of satisfaction with “Availability of extracurricular Activities” and “Quality of extracurricular activities” as both  score 40% “very satisfied”  and again  score a tie with 10% “very unsatisfied” with both indicators.
","Section 4.1 reflects students' satisfaction with the evaluation and module assessment in the light of 10 indicators (see figure 4.1.1). In general there was some level of satisfaction. However all the means fell in the second quartile with the exception of “Grade conversion across universities” which fell in the first quartile, whilst “Formalised system by university
Consortium for students to share opinions and feedback on course” and “The willingness and ability of the course coordinator to follow up on unresolved issues addressed” jointly fell on the third quartile. Students hence expressed dissatisfaction across all indicators (9% to 40% “somewhat unsatisfied”), with “Clarity of evaluation criteria across universities” recording the highest level of dissatisfaction (40% “somewhat unsatisfied”). On the positive side 12% to 56% of respondents were “very satisfied” with “The willingness and ability of the course coordinator to follow up on unresolved issues addressed” recording the highest level of satisfaction (56% “very satisfied”). 

At the Carlos III University majority of the students (85% and above) across all indicators with 33% to 58% reporting to be “very satisfied”. However 15% of respondents were “somewhat unsatisfied” with “Formalised system through which students can share their opinions and provide feedback on the EM course”.Students at Complutense University of Madrid similarly recorded high levels of satisfaction (75% and above) across all indicators although 25% were “somewhat unsatisfied” with “Implementation of recommendations given by students to improve EM course experience”. At  Ghent University, respondents equally demonstrated high levels of satisfaction (72% and above) across all indicators. However 21% of respondents were “very unsatisfied” with both  “Formalised system through which students can share their opinions and provide feedback on the EM course” and  “Implementation of recommendations given by students to improve EM course experience”. The picture at Henri Poincare University Nancy 1 is one of general significant levels of dissatisfaction with across all indicators (56%-58% dissatisfaction) with the exception of “Ability to provide feedback on the quality of services offered” and  “Feedback on evaluation results and grades” (56% and 60% satisfaction respectively). At the University of Stuttgart however, most students report high levels of satisfaction across all indicators (89% to 95%). Students here (11%) are nonetheless “somewhat dissatisfied” with both “Ability to provide feedback on the quality of services offered” and “The quality of the feedback channels at this university”

Nonetheless, 13% of students here were “somewhat unsatisfied” with “ Skills development”.  Moreover at Complutense University of Madrid (n = 17), most students (84% and above) also registered high levels of satisfaction across all indicators although 17% were “somewhat unsatisfied” with “Workload of the modules courses”. Also at  Ghent University (n = 24), more than 68% of respondents recorded high levels of satisfaction across all indicators even as  25% were “very unsatisfied” with “Use of student centered learning strategies in lectures”.  However in the case of Henri Poincare University Nancy 1 (n = 23), students recorded high levels of dissatisfaction across all indicators (15% to 58%) with “Use of innovative technology in Lectures” registering the highest level of dissatisfaction (58%).

GEMMA-Master's Degree in Women's and Gender Studies,Joanna Dziadkowiec,Felix Donkor,,"The section measures student’s satisfaction with the support received before the start of the Erasmus Mundus course. In general, students are rather satisfied with most of the course aspects.The indicator with the highest dissatisfaction level was “Information about fieldwork” with 14% of respondents being “very unsatisfied”. There is also some dissatisfaction with “Evaluation methods”, with 6% and 11% of “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” students, respectively. Another aspect of the course, “Standards of behavior”, was rated similarly with respect to student’s dissatisfaction (with 5% and 11% of “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” students, respectively). As such, these three mentioned indicators fall into the second quartile, despite the fact that in the case of the last mentioned one (“Standards of behavior”), 58% of the students reported that they are “very satisfied”. Although the “Enrolling in classes” indicator was rated as very satisfactory by 50% of the students, it falls into the first quartile. The dissatisfaction rates for this indicator are 5% and 15% of the “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” students. The two remaining course aspects: “Course content” and “Timetable” fall into the third quartile and approximately 50% of the students are “very satisfied” with them. However, it is worth mentioning that in the case of “Course content” there is also 10% of students who were “very unsatisfied” about it.","In the next section, students rated the quality of the support received during the orientation program. Overall, the majority of students are either “somewhat satisfied “ or “very satisfied” about all the rated course aspects. On the whole, students were the least satisfied with the introduction process to the” Buddy or tutor system” with 7% and 13% of the “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” answers, respectively. As such, this indicator falls into the second quartile. Another indicator, “Student associations” was rated similarly, with 6% and 12% of the “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” answers, respectively. This indicator falls into a higher, third quartile. The remaining indicators were rated very positively by the students and they all fall into the third quartile. Sixty three percent to 47% of the respondents were “very satisfied” about them.  In detail, the highest number of the “very satisfied” students was measured for both the “Administrative staff” and “Academic staff” indicators (63 %). The other indicator standing out with a positive value is “Library”, with 50% of the “somewhat satisfied” and 50% of the “very satisfied” answers, hence recording 100% satisfaction.","In this section, students gave feedback on helpfulness of units and people. In general, students’ opinions on the rated indicators vary. The least positive was the evaluation of the helpfulness of “Administrative staff” and “Student associations”, with 10% and 12% of the “very unsatisfied“ students, respectively.  As such, these two indicators are placed in the first quartile. There is also some degree of dissatisfaction with “International Student Office” (5% and 15% of the students are “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied”, respectively) and “Library” (5% and 11% of the students are “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied”, respectively). Thus, these indicators were placed in the second quartile. Another indicator that was also placed in the second quartile is “Academic staff”. Despite the majority of the students (55%) being very satisfied about it, there was 20% of “somewhat unsatisfied” answers, too. Also in the case of helpfulness of “Buddy or tutor system” unit, there is as much as 21% “somewhat unsatisfied” students and 50% “somewhat satisfied” students. However, this rating was still quite high comparing to the average and this indicator falls into the third quartile. The other two remaining indicators: “Other students” and “University facilities” were rated by 53% and 58% of the students as very satisfactory. Accordingly, they are also placed in the third quartile.","In this section, students rated the support received on “Financial issues” and “Health insurance”. Half of the students (50%) were “very satisfied” with the support received on both issues. However, there was also certain dissatisfaction about these aspects among the students. Ten percent and 20% of the respondents were “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” about the “Financial issues”, respectively. As such, the indicator falls into the first quartile. Fewer students were dissatisfied with the “Health insurance” aspect (5% and 15% of the respondents were “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied”, respectively). Accordingly, this indicator is placed in the second quartile.","In this section a number of items corresponding to the Module assessment were rated. Overall, opinions of the students on the rated indicators widely differ. The two indicators that stands out with a negative value and thus fall into the first quartile are “Grade conversion across universities” and “Information provided about the type of degrees to be awarded”. There were as many as 17% of the “very unsatisfied” and 33% of “somewhat unsatisfied” students about the first mentioned aspect. Correspondingly, there were 15% of the “very unsatisfied” and 10% of “somewhat unsatisfied” students about the aspect of “Information provided about the type of degrees to be awarded”. All the remaining indicators, apart from the “Feedback on evaluation results and grades”, are placed in the second quartile, and there is a substantial number of students, who expressed their dissatisfaction with them. Among them, the biggest number of “very unsatisfied” students (20%) was measured for “Implementation of recommendations given by students to improve EM course experience”. There is also as much as 17% and 22% of students who answered that they are “very unsatisfied” and  “somewhat unsatisfied” about the” Consistency of modules assessment across universities”, respectively. The two items: “Formalised system by university consortium for students to share opinions and feedback on course” and “The willingness and ability of the course coordinator to follow up on unresolved issues addressed” received more than one-fourth of “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” answers in total.

M.E.S.C.-Master in Materials for Energy Storage and Conversion,Tijana Maksimovic,Mattia Gusella,,"Students are in general ""very satisfied"" or ""somewhat satisfied"" with the support received before the start of their master course, but it should be noted that the majority of indicators show a roughly equal split between these two groups. The percentage of students in these two  categories combined is more than 80% for the majority of indicators in this category, with ""Evaluation methods"" (75%) and ""Information about fieldwork"" (78%) being the exceptions. All but two of the indicators are placed in the third quartile of the Erasmus Mundus courses. In the assessment of individual members of the consortium, ""Language courses"" show significant percentages of ""somewhat unsatisfied"" and ""very unsatisfied"" students across all five universities, ranging from 22% and 57% for the two groups of students combined. This is the only indicator that stands out in a negative way in the assessment of the Aix-Marseille University, where 6% of students are ""very unsatisfied"" and 19% are ""somewhat unsatisfied"" with the ""Language courses"". It reaches an exceptional level at the Paul Sabatier University, where 57% of students are ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied""  with ""Language courses"" (30% and 27%, respectively). Another 28% of students are ""somewhat unsatisfied"" (19%) or ""very unsatisfied"" (9%) with the support related to ""Banking"" provided by this university. At the University of Cordoba, 16% of students are ""very unsatisfied"" and 20% are ""somewhat unsatisfied"" with the information and support related to ""Language courses"", while another total of 38% of students are ""very unsatisfied"" and ""somewhat unsatisfied"" with ""Accommodation"". The University of Picardie Jules Verne left 31% of students ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"" with ""Language courses"", and another 27% with ""Visa issues"". At the Warsaw University of Technology, the percentage of students ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"" with ""Language courses"" amounts to 22%, while it reaches 27% for information and support related to ""Banking"" and 21% for ""Accommodation"". One indicator which has left more than 90% of students ""very satisfied"" or ""somewhat satisfied"" in all five universities is ""Local transportation"". 
","Although 70% or more students are ""very satisfied"" or ""somewhat satisfied"" with the majority of indicators related to the support received during the orientation programmes, with , this result places the master course mainly in the first quartile of the Erasmus Mundus masters. The indicators ""Buddy or tutor system"", ""International Student Office"", and ""Student associations"" left the largest percentages of students ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"" - 38%, 31%, and 34% respectively. The same is, on average, true for these indicators in the assessment of individual universities in the consortium. The assessment of the Paul Sabatier University's support stands out in terms of the percentage of students who are ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"" with ""Buddy or tutor system"" (43%) and ""Student associations"" (46%), but this result is similar for most of the other universities. 
","The percentages of students who are ""very satisfied"" or ""somewhat satisfied"" with the helpfulness of units and people are overall relatively high, and only the helpfulness of ""Administrative staff"", ""Buddy or tutor system"", ""International student office"" and ""Student associations"" has left more than a quarter of students ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatified"". Even so, the majority of indicators are placed in the 1st quartile and lower than most other Erasmus Mundus courses. The helpfulness at the Aix-Marseille University has left only moderate percentages of students ""somewhat unsatisfied"" and very small percentages ""very unsatisfied"", with the exception of the ""Library"" (20% of ""somewhat unsatisfied"" and only 3% of ""very unsatisfied""). The satisfaction rates are lower at the Paul Sabatier University, and especially for the ""Buddy or tutor system"", ""Student associations"" and ""Library"" (38%, 41% and 30% of ""very unsatisfied"" and ""somewhat unsatisfied"", respectively). At the University of Cordoba, University Picardie Jules Verne and Warsaw University of Technology show the largest percentages of ""very unsatisfied"" and ""somewhat unsatisfied"" students in  the indicators ""Buddy or tutor system"", ""International student office"" and ""Student associations"" (between 20% and 25%), though the first university has larger percentages of ""very unsatisfied"" students than those who are ""somewhat unsatisfied"".
","Even though the percentages of students who are ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"" with the support received on various issues are relatively small at the consortium level, these indicators place in the first and second quartiles among the Erasmus Mundus courses, which should be a cause for some concern. This is especially valid for the support related to ""Inappropriate conduct or sexual harassment issues"", which 12% of students are ""very unsatisfied"" with. The individual universities show a similar pattern, with smaller percentages of students being ""very unsatisfied"" and ""somewhat unsatisfied"" with ""Availability of extracurricular activities"" (between 21% and 39%) than with the ""Quality of extracurricular activities"" (between 16% and 37%). ","The module assessment has left students moderately satisfied; between 19% and 38% of students are ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"" with the indicators, the majority of which are placed in the second quartile. One indicator that stands out is ""Consistency of module assessment across universities"", which places in the fourth quartile of all Erasmus Mundus courses, although it is not the indicator with the smallest total percentage of ""very unsatisfied"" and ""somewhat unsatisfied"" students (23%). Similarly, the only indicators in the first quartile - ""Information provided about provision of certificates and transcripts"" and ""Information about the type of degrees to be awarded"" are not the ones with the greatest percentages of ""very unsatisfied"" and ""somewhat unsatisfied"" students (34% and 26%, respectively). The individual universities show fairly even percentages across different indicators. Warsaw University of Technology has the smallest percentages of ""very unsatisfied"" and ""somewhat unsatisfied"" students, ranging between 13% and 19%. For the University of Cordoba, they range between 12% and 18%, with one indicator at 25%. For Paul Sabatier University and University of Picardie Jules Verne, these percentages are between 16% and 32% for the former, and 17% and 33% for the latter. In the case of Aix-Marseille University, these percentages are between 20% and 34%, but the percentages of ""very unsatisfied"" students are considerably lower than those of ""somewhat unsatisfied"" students for all the indicators.
","Teaching/learning have left fairly high percentages of students fairly ""very satisfied"" or ""somewhat satisfied"", but they are spread differently across across the universities. ""Use of innovative technology in lectures"" and ""Use of student centered learning strategies in lectures"" particularly stand out in terms of the percentages of students who are ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"" with these elements, while ""Workload of the modules courses"" can be singled out as the indicator most students are ""very satisfied"" or ""somewhat satisfied"" with. University of Picardie Jules Verne is an exception to this pattern, with ""Workload of the modules courses"" being one of the two indicators with the largest percentage of ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"" students (21%), and ""Use of innovative technology in lectures"" and ""Use of student centered learning strategies in lectures"" showing smaller numbers of ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"" students than in the majority of other universities in the consortium. University of Cordoba has left overall the smallest percentages of students ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"", but it needs to be noted that, unlike other universities, the majority of them are ""very unsatisfied"". 
","For the First supervisor, 88% of students ""agree"" or ""somewhat agree"" with the statements ""My supervisor provided valuable advice during my thesis work"" and ""My supervisor was available for periodic meetings"", but both of the indicators fall within the second quartile. ","The ratings of the second supervisor are also very unified, and between 88% and 92% of students ""agree"" or ""somewhat agree"" witht the following statements: ""My second supervisor was available for consultation if the lead supervisor was unavailable"", ""My supervisor provided valuable advice during my thesis work"" and ""My supervisor was available for periodic meetings"". All three indicators are placed in the third quartile.
","The elements related to the students' personal development are mostly rated positively in the present survey. An interesting possible contradiction can be noted in the fact that all (100%) of the surveyed students ""agree"" or ""somewhat agree"" with the statement ""I feel my Erasmus Mundus course has prepared me for my future chosen career"", while only 78% ""agree"" or ""somewhat agree"" with the statement ""I fell my Erasmus Mundus course prepared me for my career"". The students seem to assess most favourably the elements related to their future employment, and 91% ""agree"" or ""somewhat agree"" with the claim ""I feel optimistic about my opportunities for employment"", while 87% ""agree"" or ""somewhat agree""  that ""My soft skills were improved by my course"". The majority of the assessed indicators place this master course in the first and the second quartile of Erasmus Mundus programmes. The only expections are ""I feel my Erasmus Mundus course has prepared me for my future chosen career"" and ""I feel optimistic about my opportunities for employment"" in the fourth quartile, and ""I was well advised by my course on future education options"" in the third quartile. ","The students are to a large extent satisfied with their field experience during the master course: all of the participants in the survey are either ""somewhat satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with this segment. The only exception is the ""Duration of field experience"", which has left 8% of the surveyed students ""somewhat unsatisfied"". These results, though, place this master in the third quartile of the Erasmus Mundus programmes, while the indicator ""Relevance to field study"" is only in the second quartile. ",,,,Yes,Yes,No,

MEEES-Masters in Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Seismology,Ana Godonoga,Xinyu Wang,,"Section 3.1 measures students’ satisfaction with the support received before the start of their Erasmus Mundus course. When analyzing the findings, it is important to mention that throughout the entire report, higher levels of satisfaction are measured in terms of percentages of “very satisfied” responses, while lower levels are treated as the sum of “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” responses. 

Graph 3.1.1 provides information on students’ satisfaction with the support received by the program consortia as a whole. The following 6 indicators were used in this question:  (1) “Course content”, (2) “Enrolling in classes”, (3) “Evaluation methods”, (4) “Information about field work”, (5) “Standards of behavior”, and (6) “Timetable”. Overall, the graph shows that the majority of respondents reported being “somewhat satisfied” or “very satisfied” with the information and support received by the consortia in terms of all 6 indicators. 

A considerable number of students reported being “somewhat unsatisfied” with the “Information about fieldwork” (43%), and “Evaluation methods” (29%). In addition 13% of respondents stated being “somewhat unsatisfied” with the support provided in terms of “Enrolling in classes” and “Timetable”, and 7% of respondents reported being “somewhat unsatisfied” with the help received with respect to “Course content”. All indicators are distributed in the third quartile, except for “Information about fieldwork”, which appears in the first quartile (Table 1). Indicators with the highest levels of satisfaction (as measured by the percentages of “very satisfied” responses) are: “Enrolling in classes” (60%), and “Standards of behavior” (57%). The remaining indicators recorded between 21% and 43% of “very satisfied” responses. 

Apart from rating their satisfaction with the consortia, students were also asked to rate the support received from each university. However, due to a low number of responses, only the Institute for Advanced Study of Pavia was considered in this analysis. The following 7 indicators were used in this subsection: (1) “Accommodation”, (2) “Banking”, (3) “Estimation of living expenses”, (4) “Health insurance”, (5) “Language courses”, (6) “Local transportation”, and (7) “Visa issues”. Graph 3.1.2 reveals a high variation amongst students’ satisfaction with the logistic information and support received from the Institute for Advanced Study of Pavia. Respondents indicated being particularly “very unsatisfied” with the support provided with respect to “Language courses” (70%). In addition, 31% of respondents marked being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with the information received with regards to “Local transportation” and “Accommodation”, and 27% of respondents expressed being “very unsatisfied” with the support offered on “Health Insurance”. It is worth noting that only 2 of the 7 indicators scored more than 50% of “very satisfied” responses. To specify, 69% of respondents stated being “very satisfied” with the information received on the subject of “Accommodation” and 64% - on “Health Insurance”.
","Section 3.2 measures students’ satisfaction with the support received by the consortia and by individual universities during the orientation program. The following 8 indicators were used in this analysis: (1) “Academic staff”, (2) “Administrative staff”, (3) “Buddy or tutor system”, (4) “International Student Office”, (5) “Library”, (6) “Other students”, (7) “Student associations”, and (8) “University facilities”. Graph 3.2.1 provides information on students’ satisfaction with the support received by the program consortia during the orientation program. The majority of respondents stated being “very satisfied” or “somewhat satisfied” with all indicators, except for “Buddy or tutor system”, where 63% of respondents indicated feeling “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied”. Lower levels of satisfaction were also recorded for the indicators “International Student Office” (29% of “somewhat unsatisfied” responses) and “Administrative staff” (27% of “somewhat unsatisfied” responses). Only 2 of the 8 indicators registered more than 50% of “very satisfied” responses: “Academic staff” (60%) and “Other students” (54%). As regards the distribution among quartiles, one indicators falls in the first quartile (“Buddy or tutor system”), 4 indicators appear in the second quartile (“Academic staff”, “Administrative staff”, “International Student Office” and “Library”) and 2 indicators fall in the third quartile (“Other students” and “University facilities”).

Taking into consideration the low number of responses provided for the other consortium partners, only the Institute for Advanced Study of Pavia was included in this analysis. Graph 3.2.2 illustrates that the vast majority of respondents (total n=14) indicated being “very satisfied” or “somewhat satisfied” with all indicators. A particular high level of satisfaction was recorded for “Other students”, where almost ¾ of respondents marked “very satisfied” as an answer. A proportion of respondents listed being “somewhat unsatisfied” with the introduction process to “Academic staff” (21%), “Library” (18%), and “University facilities” (15%). For the remaining indicators, the incidence of “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” responses amounted to less than 10%.
","Section 3.3 measures students’ satisfaction with the helpfulness of different units and people. Students were asked to rate their satisfaction with the consortia and with individual universities respectively. However, due to a low number of responses, only results concerning the Institute for Advanced Study of Pavia were presented in this section. 

The following seven indicators were presented to the respondents – (1) “Academic staff”, (2) “Administrative staff”, (3) “Buddy or tutor system”, (4) “International Student Office”, (5) “Library”, (6) “Other students” and (7) “University Facilities”. The graph illustrates a somewhat mixed distribution of responses. While the majority of respondents marked “very satisfied” or “somewhat satisfied” as an answer for all indicators, a considerable number of respondents (40%) stated being “somewhat unsatisfied” with the helpfulness of “Buddy of tutor system”. In addition, it is worth mentioning that all indicators recorded at least 14% of “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” responses (summed together). With respect to the distribution among quartiles, 2 indicators are located in the second quartile (“Buddy or tutor system” and “Library”) and the remaining indicators appear in the second quartile (Table 3). In the case of the Institute for Advanced Study of Pavia, all indicators except for one (“Health services”) recorded more than 50% of “very satisfied” responses. Indicators scoring somewhat lower levels of satisfaction compared to others are “Health services” (36%), “Library” (33%), and “Other students” (17%).
","Section 3.4 measures students’ satisfaction with the support received on various issues. With respect to the guidance provided by the program consortia as a whole, students were asked to rate their satisfaction in regards to 2 indicators: (1) “Financial issues” and (2) “Health insurance”. Although the majority of respondents (more than 50%) reported being “very satisfied” with the support received, a considerable proportion (35%) indicated being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with the guidance provided on “Financial issues”. Likewise, 14% marked being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with the assistance received on the topic of “Health insurance”. These indicators are distributed in the first and second quartile, as shown in table 4. 

As far as individual universities are concerned, students were asked to rate their satisfaction with (1) the “Availability of extracurricular activities” and (2) the “Quality of extracurricular activities”. 
Once again, due to a limited number of responses, only the Institute for Advanced Study of Pavia was included in this analysis. The visual representation of the distribution of responses provided in figure 3.4.2 reveals a large variation of opinions. Approximately 45% of respondents (total n=14) indicated being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with the “Availability of extracurricular activities”, and 40% marked “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” as an answer when asked to rate the “Quality of extracurricular activities”. Less than 30% of respondents selected “very satisfied” as an answer for both indicators. 
","Section 4.1 measures students’ satisfaction with the evaluation and module assessment. Respondents were asked to rate their satisfaction with respect to 8 indicators (see graph 4.1.1). As regards the consortia, almost one half of respondents indicated being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with the “Clarity of evaluation criteria across universities” (47%), the “Consistency of module assessment across universities” (47%), and with the “Grade conversion across universities” (45%). The first two indicators fall in the first quartile on the distribution table and the latter – in the second quartile (Table 5). In addition, around one third of respondents marked “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” as an answer on the indicators “Feedback on evaluation results and grades” (36%), and “Availability of course coordinator to discuss questions or problems related to my studies and mobility experience” (29%). These indicators appear in the second quartile of the distribution table.  Only in the case of 2 indicators, which appear in the fourth quartile, more than 50% of respondents expressed feeling “very satisfied”, namely “Information provided about the type of degrees to be awarded” (21%) and “Information provided about provision of certificates and transcripts” (58%). 

As regards the Institute for Advanced Study of Pavia, 4 indicators were used to measure students’ satisfaction with the evaluation and assessment provided by the respective institution: (1) “Ability to provide feedback on the quality of courses”, (2) “Feedback on evaluation results and grades”, (3) “Formalized system through which students can share their opinions and provide feedback on the EM course”, and (4) “The quality of the feedback channels at this university”. Respondents seem to have different opinions with respect to the evaluation and assessment methods employed by the institution. To specify, fifty percent or more of respondents indicated being “very satisfied” with the “Ability to provide feedback on the quality of courses” (58%) and with the “The quality of the feedback channels at this university” (50%). At the same time, slightly more than one third of respondents indicated feeling “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with the “Feedback on evaluation results and grades” (38%) and with the “Formalized system through which students can share their opinions and provide feedback on the EM course” (36%).  
","In section 5.1, students were asked to rate their satisfaction with the organization of teaching and learning at each university. Six indicators were used in this section: (1) “Academic support and advice from lectures”, (2) “Overall quality of teaching at this university”, (3) Skills development, (4) “Use of innovative technology in lectures”, (5) “Use of student centered learning strategies in lectures”, and (6) “Workload of the modules courses”. Findings have been reported and described only for the Institute for Advanced Study of Pavia. More than half of respondents (n=14) reported feeling “very satisfied” with all indicators. Somewhat lower levels of satisfaction (as measured by the percentage of “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” responses) were identified in regards to “Workload of the modules courses” (28%) and “Use of student centered learning strategies in lectures” (23%). ",,,,,,,,Yes,No,No,
MEME-Erasmus Mundus Master Programme in Evolutionary Biology,Habtamu Diriba Garomssa,Sonja Song,,"Table1 presents information about the satisfaction level of students regarding the support they received from the consortia before the start of Erasmus Mundus masters course on six different dimensions. In general, the majority of the students are, at least “somewhat satisfied” with the support they received prior the start of the course. Satisfaction level was highest in the dimension of “Standards of behavior” which lied in the fourth quartile with a mean score of M=3.71. Similarily, “Course content”, “Information about fieldwork”, and “Timetable” all fall in the fourth quartile with a Mean score of 3.46, 3.46 and 3.38, respectively. In contrast, the lowest level of satisfaction was reported with respect to “Evaluation methods” dimension, which fall in the third quartile with a Mean score of M=3.17. 
Lastly, it is worth mentioning that a similar trend was observed regarding the participating universities with the exception of “Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich” university which created some level of dissatisfaction amongst the majority of the respondents in one of the indicators i.e., “Accommodation”. Specifically, 23% and 31% of the students reported that they are “Very unsatisfied” and “Somewhat unsatisfied” with the “Accommodation” support, respectively.
","Table 2 summarizes the satisfaction level of students about the orientation they received from the consortia. Overall, the majority of the students reported that they are at least “somewhat satisfied” with the Support received during the orientation program. To be more precise, students were “Very satisfied” with the orientation about “Academic staff”, “Administrative staff”, and “University facilities”, with a Mean scores of 3.71, 3.67, and 3.67, respectively. It is also worth noting that each of the Mean scores lie in the fourth quartile. On the other hand, satisfaction levels were markedly lower when it came to the orientation support received regarding “Buddy or tutor system” and “Library”, with the Mean score of each falling in the second quartile. Lastly, it can also be seen in table 2 that the Mean value for the remaining two units (“International student office” and Student associations) is in the third quartile.
However, when it comes to the participating universities, a varying level of student satisfaction is evident. In that, while “Uppsala University, Sweden” has all students (in all the indicators) in the either “somewhat satisfied” or “Very satisfied” range, “Montpellier 2 University, France”, created higher level of dissatisfaction (measured as “Somewhat unsatisfied” and “Very unsatisfied”) in the majority of the indicators. Satisfaction level was markedly lowest in the case of “International office” dimension, which was framed as somewhat or very unsatisfactory by 81% of the respondents. Similarily, “University of Groningen, Netherlands” created considerably higher level of satisfaction as compared to “Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany”.
","Overall the vast majority of the respondents are at least “Somewhat satisfied” with the “Helpfulness of units of people”. More particularly, the respondents were most satisfied with “Academic staff” which fall in the fourth quartile with a mean score of M=3.79. Similarily, “University facilities”, and “Student associations” each fall in the fourth quartile with a Mean score of 3.71, and 3.25, correspondingly. This is in contrast to the helpfulness of “Administrative staff” and “International student office” which fall in the second quartile with mean scores of M=3.42 and M=3.25. Whereas, the remaining two units of people considered, i.e., “Buddy or tutor system”, and “Library”, both fell in the third quartile. 
When it comes to the participating universities, a contrasting level of satisfaction was observed. Similar to the previous aspect analyzed (orientation), “Uppsala University, Sweden” managed to register a 100% satisfaction score (as measured by “Somewhat satisfied” and “Very satisfied” scales), while “Montpellier 2 University, France” created some level of dissatisfaction (i.e, either “Somewhat unsatisfied” and “Very unsatisfied”) amongst students in most of the sub scale items considered.
","As depicted in the figure above, the majority of the students are satisfied with the support received regarding “Financial Issues” and “Health Insurance” and “Inappropriate conduct or sexual harassment”. It can also be seen that with the mean score in the range of 3.34-3.54, all of them fall in the third quartile.
It is worth mentioning that the majority of the respondents are “Very satisfied” with the “Availability and Quality of extracurricular activities” in all the participating universities. In this regard “Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany” stands out with 100% of the students being either “Somewhat satisfied” or “Very satisfied” with it.
","As can be seen in Table 5, more than half of the respondents indicated that they are at least, “Somewhat satisfied” with the assessment and feedback technique of the consortia.

In general most students in the consortia demonstrated high levels of satisfaction across all indicators (66% and above). The six means are equally divided between the first (“Course content”, “Information about fieldwork” and “Standards of behaviour”) and second (“Enrolling in classes”,” Evaluation methods” and “Timetable”) quartiles. The highest level of satisfaction (96%) was with “Enrolling in classes” whilst the greatest dissatisfaction (34%) was with “Information about fieldwork”.

At Cardiff University, most respondents were similarly satisfied across all indicators (66% and above). The majority of respondents were “very satisfied” (50%) with “Estimation of living expenses” but “very unsatisfied” (18%) with “Accommodation”. 

Furthermore at the Radboud University Nijmegen, satisfaction is equally high above all indicators (50% and over). Most respondents (58%) here are “very satisfied” with “Local transportation” but “very unsatisfied” (18%) with “Language courses”.
","Section 3.2 reflects the satisfaction of respondents with the support received from the consortia and by individual universities at the orientation phase of their program. 
Survey respondents were overall satisfied with the orientation stage of their programme as most respondents reported either being “somewhat satisfied” (27% to 58%) or “very satisfied” (35% to 62%). Consequently most of the means fall in the third quartile with the exception of “Academic staff” (first quartile) and “Buddy or tutor system” which together with “Other students” fall into the second quartile. Most students in the consortia (62%) were equally “very satisfied” with “Administrative staff” and “Library”.

At Cardiff University, most respondents satisfied across all indicators (63% and above). Nonetheless majority of the respondents were “very satisfied” (78%) with “Academic staff” support whilst 25% of respondents were “very unsatisfied” with the “Buddy or tutor system”.

Radboud University Nijmegen, there was a picture of general satisfaction. Hence 62% of the student population was “very satisfied” with “Library” whilst 27% also were “very unsatisfied” with “Buddy or tutor system”.

","Section 3.3 portrays students' satisfaction with the helpfulness of units and people in the course of their studies. In all students in the consortia were generally satisfied as majority indicated either being “somewhat satisfied” (27% to 50%) or “very satisfied”  (26% to 62%). Nonetheless, majority of the means fall in the second and third quartiles. Majority of students (62%) in the consortia were “very satisfied with “Library” whilst 9% were “very unsatisfied” with both “Student associations”.

At Cardiff University, most respondents were “very satisfied” across all indicators with both “Academic staff” and “University facilities” both registering the highest level of 67% “very satisfied”. However 7% of students were “very unsatisfied” with “Buddy or tutor system”. Moreover three indicators recorded 100% satisfaction namely “Other students”, “Student associations” and “University facilities”.

","Section 3.4 summarises the students' satisfaction with the support received from the consortia and individual universities on three main issues:  (1) ""Financial issues"" and (2) ""Health insurance"".
There is a general satisfaction with the level of support received from the consortia as 76% to and 78% of respondents were satisfied with such assistance received. The means were however evenly spread across the first (“Financial issues”) and second (“Health insurance”) quartiles.
 Most students in the consortia (52%) were “very satisfied” with both indicators. However  14% were “very unsatisfied” with the help they received as per their “Financial issues”. 

At the Cardiff University, there was 100% satisfaction with both “Availability of extracurricular activities” and “Quality of extracurricular activities”. However at the Radboud University Nijmegen, satisfaction levels vary as there was 73% and 81% satisfaction with “Availability of extracurricular activities” and “Quality of extracurricular activities” respectively. 
","Section 4.1 paints a picture of students' satisfaction with the evaluation and module assessment in the light of 10 indicators (see table 5).

However all the means fell in the first and second quartile with the exception of “Feedback on evaluation results and grades”  and “Information provided about the type of degree s to be awarded” which both fell in the third quartile. Most students in the consortia were satisfied with “Information provided about the type of degree s to be awarded” (92%) whilst 44% were dissatisfied with “Implementation of recommendations given by students to improve EM course experience”.


At the Cardiff University majority of the students (88% and above) expressed satisfaction across all indicators with “Ability to provide feedback on the quality of services offered” recording 100% satisfaction.

Satisfaction levels taper at Radboud University Nijmegen, as 58% and over of students express satisfaction across all the indicators. Here 27% of the respondents are “very satisfied” with “Feedback on evaluation results and Grades” but 23% were “very unsatisfied” with “Formalised system through which students can share their opinions and provide feedback on the EM course”.
","Section 5 appraises respondents experience with teaching and learning as well as supervision. Hence 5.2 reflect students' satisfaction with the support provided by their first supervisors.

STEPS-Erasmus Mundus Master Course in Sustainable Transportation and Electrical Power Systems,Ana Godonoga,Xinyu Wang,,"Section 3.1 measures students’ satisfaction with the support received before the start of their Erasmus Mundus course. When analyzing the findings, it is important to mention that throughout the entire report, higher levels of satisfaction are measured in terms of percentages of “very satisfied” responses, while lower levels are treated as the sum of “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” responses. 

Graph 3.1.1 provides information on students’ satisfaction with the support received by the program consortia as a whole. The following 6 indicators were used in this question:  (1) “Course content”, (2) “Enrolling in classes”, (3) “Evaluation methods”, (4) “Information about field work”, (5) “Standards of behavior”, and (6) “Timetable”. Overall, the graph shows that the majority of respondents reported being “somewhat satisfied” or “very satisfied” with the information and support received by the consortia in terms of all 6 indicators. Somewhat lower levels of satisfaction (as measured by the sum of “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” responses) were identified for the following indicators: “Information about fieldwork” (18%), “Timetable” (17%), “Course content” (17%), and “Evaluation methods” (8%). Students seem to be most satisfied with the support provided on aspects, such as “Enrolling in classes” and “Standards of behavior”, which received only responses marked as “very satisfied” or “somewhat satisfied”. As far as the distribution across quartiles is concerned, four indicators appear in the third quartile and two – in the fourth quartile (Table 1). 


Apart from rating their satisfaction with the consortia, students were also asked to rate the support received from each university (graphs 3.1.2 & 3.1.3). The following 7 indicators were used in this question: (1) “Accommodation”, (2) “Banking”, (3) “Estimation of living expenses”, (4) “Health insurance”, (5) “Language courses”, (6) “Local transportation”, and (7) “Visa issues”. With respect to the University of Nottingham, 50% or more respondents (n=15) indicated being “very satisfied” with the logistic information and support provided by the institution. The incidence of “very unsatisfied” responses was identified to be zero in this analysis. Nonetheless, the institution could further improve on the support provided on the topic of “Accommodation”, taking into consideration that 33% of respondents expressed feeling “somewhat unsatisfied”. Students were notably “very satisfied” with the support received in reference to “Local transportation” (100%) and “Language courses” (90%). On the other hand, the satisfaction levels reported for the University of Oviedo are somewhat lower, compared to the University of Nottingham. It is worth mentioning that all items registered a certain number of “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” responses. In particular, respondents (n=14) expressed feeling “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with the assistance received as regards “Language courses” (36%), “Accommodation” (27%), “Estimation of living expenses” (18%), “Local transportation” (18%), and “Visa issues” (18%). Only for 2 indicators of the total number, the majority of students (more than 50%) reported being “very satisfied” – “Local transportation” (64%) and “Estimation of living expenses” (55%). 
","Section 3.2 measures students’ satisfaction with the support received by the consortia and by individual universities during the orientation program. The following 7 indicators were used in this analysis: (1) “Academic staff”, (2) “Administrative staff”, (3) “International Student Office”, (4) “Library”, (5) “Other students”, (6) “Student associations”, and (7) “University facilities”. 

Graph 3.2.1 provides information on students’ satisfaction with the support received by the program consortia during the orientation program. Overall, the majority of respondents stated being “very satisfied” or “somewhat satisfied” with all indicators. A notable exception refers to “Student associations”, for which half of the respondents expressed feeling “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied”. In addition, one quarter of respondents stated being “somewhat unsatisfied” with the introduction process to the “Library” and the “International Student Office”. The latter appears in the third quartile of the distribution table, while the first 2 variables appear in the first quartile (Table 2). Higher levels of satisfaction were reported for the indicators “Academic Staff”, “International Student Office” and “University Facilities”, where approximately two thirds of respondents marked “very satisfied” as an answer. These indicators are identified in the third and fourth quartiles of the distribution table.

The reported levels of satisfaction with respect to the introduction process of the given units of people were exceptionally high for the University of Nottingham. To specify, more than two thirds of respondents indicated feeling “very satisfied” with the introduction process to all units. Slightly lower levels of satisfaction were reported for the variables “Student associations” (27% of “somewhat unsatisfied” responses) and “Administrative staff” (18% of “somewhat unsatisfied” responses). The level of satisfaction with the institutional support offered during the orientation period by the University of Oviedo was identified to be somewhat lower, compared to the University of Nottingham. Nevertheless, still a majority of respondents expressed feeling “very satisfied” or “somewhat satisfied” with all indicators. Contrastingly, “Student associations” scored the lowest on the satisfaction scale, with 40% of summed “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” responses. 
","Section 3.3 measures students’ satisfaction with the helpfulness of different units and people. Students were asked to rate their satisfaction with the consortia and with individual universities respectively. Seven indicators were used in this section – (1) “Academic staff”, (2) “Administrative staff”, (3) “International Student Office”, (4) “Library”, (5) “Other students”, (6) “Student associations”, and (7) “University Facilities”. The graph illustrates that more than half of respondents listed being “very satisfied” with the helpfulness of the aforementioned units of people, except for “Student Associations” and “Library”, where the vast majority of respondents expressed feeling “somewhat satisfied”. A lower level of satisfaction (as measured by the sum of “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” responses) was recorded for “International Student Office” (25%). These three indicators appear in the second quartile and the remaining ones appear in the third and fourth quartiles.

When asked to provide answers for each university, participants were presented with 8 units of people: (1) Academic staff, (2) Administrative staff, (3) Health services, (4) International Student Office, (5) Library, (6) Other students, (7) Student associations and (8) University Facilities”. The level of student satisfaction reported for the University of Nottingham was exceptionally high with more than two thirds of participants marking “very satisfied” as a response for all indicators. The highest levels of satisfaction were reported for “Library”, “Other students”, and “University facilities”, with 92% of respondents expressing feeling “very satisfied”. 

In the case of the University of Oviedo, the recorded level of student satisfaction is somewhat lower, compared to the University of Nottingham. Students were asked to rate their satisfaction with the following 6 indicators: (1) “Academic staff”, (2) “Administrative staff”, (3) “Health Services”, (4) “International Student Office”, (5) “Library” and (6) “University facilities”. The majority of respondents (50% or more) marked “very satisfied” as an answers for all variables, except for “Library”, where 55% of respondents stated feeling “somewhat satisfied”. Relatively lower levels of satisfaction were identified in regards to “Administrative staff” and “International Student Office”, where 18% of respondents expressed being “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied”.
","Section 3.4 measures students’ satisfaction with the support received on various issues. With respect to the support provided by the program consortia as a whole, students were asked to rate their satisfaction with 2 indicators: (1) “Financial issues” and (2) “Health insurance”. Graph 3.4.1 illustrates that the majority of students reported being “very satisfied” or “somewhat satisfied” with the support received on the respective issues. Only 8% of respondents expressed feeling “very unsatisfied” with the support provides on the aspect of “Financial issues”. The latter indicator (“Financial issues”) falls in the third quartile and former (“Health insurance”) – in the fourth quartile respectively (table 4).

As far as individual universities are concerned, students were asked to rate their satisfaction with (1) the “Availability of extracurricular activities” and (2) the “Quality of extracurricular activities”. 
As far as the University of Nottingham is concerned, approximately two thirds of respondents reported being “very satisfied” with both indicators. With regards to the University of Oviedo, students' satisfaction with both indicators was comparatively lower. Precisely, 30% of respondents expressed feeling “very satisfied”, 40% - “somewhat satisfied” and the remaining 30% stated being either “very unsatisfied” (10%) or “somewhat unsatisfied” (20%).
","Section 4.1 measures students’ satisfaction with the evaluation and module assessment employed in the program. Respondents were asked to review 10 indicators (see graph 4.1.1). The graph reveals a wide variation in the distribution of responses. It is worth noting that all indicators recorded 15% or more of summed “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” responses. Notably higher levels of dissatisfaction were reported for the indicators – “Implementation of recommendations given by students to improve EM course experience” (59%), “Grade conversion across universities” (50%), “Formalized system by university consortium for students to share opinions and feedback on course” (50%). Furthermore, approximately one third of respondents expressed feeling “very unsatisfied” or “somewhat unsatisfied” with the “Information provided about the type of degrees to be awarded” (34%), the “Information provided about provision of certificates and transcripts” (33%), “Consistency of module assessment across universities” (33%) and the “Feedback on evaluation results and grades” (33%). Half of the indicators are placed in the first quartile of the distribution table, 2 – in the second quartile, 2 – in the third quartile, and one – in the fourth quartile (Table 5). 

As far as individual universities are concerned, respondents were asked to rate their satisfaction with respect to 6 indicators (graph 4.1.2). Regarding the University of Nottingham, 50% or more respondents stated feeling “very satisfied” with all indicators pertaining to assessment and evaluation. The incidence of “somewhat unsatisfied” responses was relatively low (less than 10% of respondents). Furthermore, it is worth noting that none of the indicators were marked with “very unsatisfied” by any respondent. The levels of satisfaction concerning the assessment and evaluation process at the University of Oviedo were significantly lower. To specify, the lowest levels of satisfaction (as measured by the percentage sum of “very unsatisfied” and “somewhat unsatisfied” responses) were reported for the following indicators: “Formalised system through which students can share their opinions and provide feedback on the EM course” (54%), “Ability to provide feedback on the quality of courses” (45%), and “The quality of the feedback channels at this university” (45%). In addition, close to one third of respondents stated feeling “somewhat unsatisfied” with the “Implementation of recommendations given by students to improve EM course experience” (30%) and with the “Feedback on evaluation results and grades” (27%). 
","Section 5.1 measures students’ satisfaction with the support provided by their first supervisor. Graph 5.1 shows that while a majority of respondents seem to “agree” or “somewhat agree” with the statements: “My supervisor provided valuable advice during my thesis work” and “My supervisor was available for periodic meetings”, 10% marked “somewhat disagree” when rating the respective statements.  As illustrated in Table 6, the two indicators are located in the first and second quartiles. (PLEASE NOTE THAT SECTION 5.1 IN THIS SPECIFIC REPORT PERTAINS TO FIRST SUPERVISOR AND SECTION 5.2 - TO TEACHING/LEARNING)","In section 5.2, students were asked to rate their satisfaction with the organization of teaching and learning at each university.
