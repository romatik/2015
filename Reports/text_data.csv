ADVANCES-Advanced Development in Social Work,Ana,,,"Section 3.1 measures students' satisfaction with the support received before the start of their Erasmus Mundus course. When analyzing the findings, it is important to mention that throughout the entire report, higher levels of satisfaction are measured in terms of percentages of ""very satisfied"" responses, while lower levels are treated as the sum of ""very unsatisfied"" and ""unsatisfied"" responses. Graph 3.1.1 provides information on students' satisfaction with the support received by the program consortia as a whole. The following 6 indicators were used in this question:  (1) ""Course content"", (2) ""Enrolling in classes"", (3) Evaluation methods, (4) ""Information about field work"", (5) ""Standards of behavior"", and (6) ""Timetable"". Overall, the graph shows that the majority of respondents reported being ""somewhat satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with the information and support received by the consortia with respect to all 6 indicators. Lower levels of satisfaction (as measured by the sum of ""very unsatisfied"" and ""somewhat unsatisfied"" responses) were recorded for the following indicators: ""Information about fieldwork"" (21%), ""Evaluation methods"" (17%), ""Timetable"" (12%), ""Course content"" (8%), and ""Enrolling in classes"" (4%). Nevertheless, all of these indicators fall in the fourth quartile, except for ""Course content"" and ""Information about fieldwork"", which appear to be in the third quartile (see Table 1). Higher levels of satisfaction (as measured by the percentages of ""very satisfied responses"") were recorded for the indicators ""Enrolling in classes"" (71%), and ""Standards of behavior"" (65%). Both indicators fall in the fourth quartile. Apart from rating their satisfaction with the consortia, students were also asked to rate the support received from each university (graphs 3.1.2 & 3.1.3). The following 7 indicators were used in this question: (1) ""Accommodation, (2) ""Banking"", (3) ""Estimation of living expenses"", (4) ""Health insurance"", (5) ""Language courses"", (6) ""Local transportation"", and (7) ""Visa issues"". The majority of students reported being either ""very satisfied"" or ""somewhat satisfied"" with the support provided by Aalborg University (n=25) and the University of Lincoln (n=24). In the case of Aalborg University, it is important to note that all indicators registered a certain number of ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat satisfied"" responses. Indicators with the lowest levels of satisfaction are the following: ""Banking"" (41%), ""Estimation of living expenses"" (24%), and ""Local transportation"" (20%). In addition, more than 50% of respondents stated being ""very satisfied"" with three indicators - accommodation (55%), health insurance (55%) and local transportation (52%). In the case of the University of Lincoln, the lowest levels of satisfaction were recorded for the indicators ""Accommodation"" (29%), ""Estimation of living expenses"" (21%), and ""Local transportation"" (14%). Students reported being ""very satisfied"" with the support offered in regards to ""Banking"" (75%), ""Visa issues"" (75%), ""Health insurance"" (74%), and ""Language courses"" (74%). Due to a low number of respondents, findings concerning the Technical University of Lisbon were not included in this analysis.","Section 3.2 measures students' satisfaction with the support received by the consortia and by individual universities during the orientation program. The following 8 indicators were used in this analysis: (1) ""Academic staff"", (2) ""Administrative staff"", (3) ""Buddy or tutor system"", (4) ""International Student Office"", (5) ""Library"", (6) ""Other students"", (7) ""Student associations"", and (8) ""University Facilities"". Graph 3.2.1 provides information on students' satisfaction with the support received by the program consortia during the orientation program. Overall, the majority of respondents stated being ""very satisfied"" or ""somewhat satisfied"" with all indicators. The lowest levels of satisfaction were recorded for the indicators ""Student associations"" (18%), ""Other students"" (12%), and ""International Student Office"" (12%). In addition, the indicators ""International Student Office"" and ""Other students"" fall in the second quartile, and ""Student associations"" - in the third quartile (see Table 2). Students were ""very satisfied"" with the support received from ""Academic staff"" (83%), ""Library"" (79%), ""University facilities"" (71%), and ""Administrative staff"" (71%). All of these indicators appear to be in the fourth quartile. Twenty-five respondents rated their satisfaction with the support provided by Aalborg University during the orientation period. The lowest levels of satisfaction were recorded for the indicators ""Student associations"" (25%) and ""Buddy or tutor system"" (15%). The highest levels of satisfaction were registered for the indicators: ""Library"" (71%), ""University facilities"" (71%) and ""Academic staff"" (70%). Eighteen respondents rated their satisfaction with the support offered by the Technical University of Lisbon during the orientation period. Due to a limited number of responses, only four indicators were included in this analysis: (1) ""Academic staff"", (2) ""Administrative staff"", (3) ""Library"", and (4) ""University facilities"". The levels of satisfaction with the academic staff and administrative staff are somewhat mixed. Results concerning the indicators ""Library"" and ""University facilities"" show a more alarming situation. Approximately 70% of respondents reported being ""somewhat unsatisfied"" or ""very unsatisfied' with the introduction process to library services, and 50% with the university facilities. Twenty-four respondents rated their satisfaction with the support offered by the University of Lincoln during the orientation period. The level of satisfaction with the institutional support offered during the orientation period appears to be the highest, compared to the other two universities. Two indicators recorded slightly lower levels of satisfaction: ""Buddy or tutor system"" (15%), and ""Student associations"" (13%). Highest levels of satisfaction were identified for the indicators ""Administrative staff"" (88%), Library (88%), ""Academic staff"" (79%), and ""University facilities"" (79%).","Section 3.3 measures students' satisfaction with the helpfulness of units and people. Following the same trend, students were asked to rate their satisfaction with the consortia and with individual universities. Eight indicators were used in this section - (1) ""Academic staff"", (2) ""Administrative staff"", (3) ""Buddy or tutor system"", (4) ""International Student Office"", (5) ""Library"", (6) ""Other students"", (7) ""Student associations"", and (8) ""University Facilities"". Overall, the summary statistics table shows that students are generally satisfied with the helpfulness of the aforementioned units of people. Lowest levels of satisfaction were recorded for the indicators ""Student associations"" (26%), ""Other students"" (12%), and ""International student Office"" (9%). These indicators are distributed in the second, first, and respectively, third quartile (see Table 3). Highest levels of satisfaction were recorded for the indicators ""Academic Staff"" (83%) ""Administrative staff"" (67%) and ""Library"" (62%). These measures fall in the fourth quartile. In the case of Aalborg University, respondents (n=25) expressed somewhat lower satisfaction with respect to ""Student associations"" (27%) and ""Other students"" (15%). As regards the remaining indicators, 50% of respondents or more indicated being ""very satisfied"" with the helpfulness of the given units of people. In the case of Technical university of Lisbon, only 4 indicators were analyzed due to a limited number of responses. These indicators are (1) ""Academic staff"", (2)"" Administrative staff"", (3) ""Library"", and (4) ""University facilities"". As it appeared in the previous question, more than half of respondents (n=18) reported being ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"" with the ""Library"" (60% of ""very unsatisfied and somewhat unsatisfied responses"") and ""University facilities"" (60% of ""somewhat unsatisfied responses""). As regards ""Academic staff"" and ""Administrative staff"", the majority of students reported being either ""somewhat satisfied' or ""very satisfied"". The University of Lincoln recorded the highest level of student satisfaction among the three institutions. Somewhat lower levels of satisfaction were identified in the case of ""Student associations"" (14%) and ""Buddy or tutor system"" (12%). On the other hand, students reported being ""very satisfied"" with the helpfulness of the ""Library"" (91%), ""Academic staff"" (83%) and ""University facilities"" (83%).","Section 3.4 measures students' satisfaction with the support received from the consortia and individual universities on various issues.  As regards the support received from the program consortia, students were asked to rate their satisfaction in regards to 2 indicators: (1) ""Financial issues"" and (2) ""Health insurance"". The graph shows that although the majority of students reported being ""very satisfied"" or ""somewhat satisfied"" with the support received, these indicators fall in the second and third quartile, as shown in table 4. As regards the individual universities, students were asked to rate their satisfaction with (1) the ""Availability of extracurricular activities"" and (2) the ""Quality of extracurricular activities"". It is important to mention that due to a limited number of responses, only Alborg University and the University of Lincoln were included in this analysis. In the case of Aalborg University, approximately one third of respondents (total n=25) reported being ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"" with the ""Availability of extracurricular activities"" and almost 40% stated being ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"" with the ""Quality of extracurricular activities"". As regards the University of Lincoln, students' satisfaction with both indicators was higher. Approximately 90% of respondents (total n=24) stated being ""very satisfied"" or ""somewhat satisfied"" with the ""Quality of extracurricular activites"". At the same time, 19% of respondents stated being ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"" with the ""Availability of extracurricular activities"". This finding perhaps suggests that while the quality of activities is high, they are not necessarily made available to students.","Section 4.1 measures students' satisfaction with the evaluation and module assessment. Respondents were asked to rate their satisfaction with respect to 10 indicators (see graph 4.1.1). As regards the consortia, lower levels of satisfaction were recorded for the following indicators: ""Clarity of evaluation criteria across universities"" (38%), ""Feedback on evaluation results and grades"" (25%), ""Formalized system by university consortium for students to share opinions and feedback on course"" (19%), and ""Grade conversion across universities"" (17%). On the contrary, a considerable number of students reported being ""very satisfied"" with the ""Availability of course coordinator to discuss questions or problems related to their studies and mobility experience"" (87%) and ""The willingness and availability of the course coordinator to follow up on unresolved issues addressed"" (88%). All of the indicators used in this question fall either in the third or fourth quartile (see Table 5). In the case of Aalborg University, 6 indicators were used to measure students' satisfaction with the evaluation and assessment provided by the institution (see graph 4.1.2). Overall, the majority of respondents (total n=25) reported being ""very satisfied"" or ""somewhat satisfied"" with all indicators. One indicator that scored a lower level of satisfaction is ""Feedback on evaluation results and grades"". Approximately 33% of respondents stated being ""somewhat unsatisfied"" with the feedback received on their grades.  In the case of the Technical University of Lisbon, 5 indicators were employed (see graph 4.1.3). Approximately one third of respondents (total n=18) reported being ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"" with the ""Formalized system through which students can share their opinions and provide feedback on the EM course"", ""Feedback on evaluation results and grades"" and ""The quality of the feedback channels at this university"". In addition, 27% stated being ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"" with the ""Ability to provide feedback on the quality of courses"" and 18% expressed being ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"" with the ""Ability to provide feedback on the quality of services offered"". As regards the University of Lincoln, students' satisfaction with the module assessment was the highest among all institutions. The university could improve further on the ""Feedback on evaluation results and grades"", given that 12% of respondents stated being ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"". The indicator with the highest level of satisfaction is ""Implementation of recommendations given by students to improve EM course experience"" (74%).","Section 5.1 is comprised of two parts. Firstly, it measures students' satisfaction with the support provided by their first and second supervisors. Secondly, it analyzes students' satisfaction with respect to the organization of teaching and learning at each university. As regards students' satisfaction with the support received from their first supervisor, all respondents seem to ""agree"" or ""somewhat agree"" that their supervisors provided valuable advice during their thesis work and that they were available for periodic meetings. These indicators fall in the third and fourth quartile respectively (see Table 6). Satisfaction with the support received from the second supervisor is somewhat lower. Approximately one third of respondents ""disagree"" or ""somewhat disagree"" that their second supervisor was available for periodic meetings and 27% ""disagree"" or ""somewhat disagree"" that their supervisor provided valuable advice during their thesis work. In addition, when asked to provide feedback on the statement ""my second supervisor was available for consultation if the lead supervisor was unavailable"", 27% of respondents disagreed or somewhat disagreed. All three indicators fall in the second quartile (see Table 7). In the second part of the question, students were asked to rate their satisfaction with the organization of teaching and learning at each university. Six indicators were used in this section: (1) ""Academic support and advice from lectures"", (2) ""Overall quality of teaching at this university"", (3) Skills development, (4) ""Use of innovative technology in lectures"", (5) Use of students centered learning strategies in lectures, and (6) Workload of the modules courses. In the case of Aalborg University, more than half of respondents (total n=25) reported being ""very satisfied"" on all indicators, except for ""Use of innovative technology in lectures"", where only 43% stated being ""very satisfied"" and 52% - ""somewhat satisfied"". The incidence of ""somewhat unsatisfied"" responses was the lowest among all institutions, which indicates that on average, students are most satisfied with the teaching and learning provided by this university. In the case of Technical University of Lisbon, students' overall satisfaction with teaching and learning is lower compared to Aalborg University. Around 36% of respondents (total n=18) stated being ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"" with the indicators ""Skills development"" and ""Use of student centered learning strategies in lectures"". In addition, 27% reported being ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"" with the ""Overall quality of teaching at this university"", ""Use of innovative technology in lectures"", and ""Workload of the modules courses"". As regards the University of Lincoln, more than half of respondents (total n=24) stated being ""very satisfied"" on 4 out of 6 indicators. A higher level of dissatisfaction (as measured by the percentages of ""very unsatisfied"" or ""somewhat unsatisfied"" responses) was recorded for the indicator ""Workload of the modules courses"" (42%) and ""Skills development"" (12%).",,,"As part of question 6.1, students were asked to reflect on their personal development during their EM course. More specifically, students were presented with five statements related to career options, opportunities for employment, future education options, improvement of soft skills, academic and personal achievement, and were asked whether they agreed or disagreed with them. Results show that 82% of students ""agree"" that their soft skills were improved by their course, 70% ""agree"" that the course has enabled academic and personal achievement beyond their initial expectations, and 58% ""agree"" that their EM course prepared them for their future career. On the other hand, 33% ""disagree"" or ""somewhat disagree"" that they feel optimistic about their opportunities for employment. In addition, 50% of respondents ""disagree"" or ""somewhat disagree"" that they were well advised on future education options. Table 8 shows that all indicators covered in this section fall in the second and third quartiles.",,,,,Yes,No,No

The University of Leipzig's support has satisfied more than 90% of students on almost all indicators, while for the University of Wroclaw this percentage is around 85%. The University of Vienna's support is deemed slightly less satisfactory, especially regarding ""Accommodation"" and ""Language courses"" (over 30% students are unsatisfied), and ""Banking"" and ""Visa issues"" (20% or more). ","Students on average show similar levels of satisfaction with the support received during the orientation program - around 70-80% are somewhat or very satisfied.

The indicator with the most positive assessment is ""Other students"" (88% are satisfied), and is the only one in the 4th quartile of EM courses. The Universities of Leipzig and Vienna show similar results as the ones statistics summary - students are mostly unsatisfied with the two already mentioned indicators.
